# AlertDialog 
This repository provides a simple demonstration of how to use the Default AlertDialog in Android. AlertDialog is used to display messages to the user with various options like OK, Cancel, or custom buttons. It is a subclass of the Dialog class and can be customized to include additional buttons or views.

## Types of AlertDialog:

**1. Default AlertDialog:** It uses ```AlertDialog.Builder``` to set up the dialog and then displays it with the show() method.

**2. Custom AlertDialog:** It creates an AlertDialog using ```AlertDialog.Builder```, sets the custom view, and then adds two buttons ("OK" and "Cancel").
The custom layout can include more complex views like ```EditText```, ```TextView```, ```ImageView```, etc., to meet your needs.

## Features

- Display a basic AlertDialog with Yes, No, and Help buttons.
- Use ``DialogInterface.OnClickListener`` to handle button clicks.
- Handle back press events to show the exit confirmation dialog.
